Discraria is a mod created by combining the names Terraria and Discord. This mod displays activity in your Discord profile using Rich Presence. Currently, this mod displays the following information about the player:

• Player presence in the main menu;
• The biome the player is in;
• World type and difficulty;
• Boss fighting;
• Maximum health, mana and defense.

Sometimes, when frequently changing activity in your Discord profile using Rich Presence (For example: frequent movement between biomes), there is a chance that the activity may not update in your profile. To fix this issue, you need to wait a few seconds and then trigger an activity update (For example: move to a new biome, die, summon a boss, exit to the menu). However, this is not necessary, as after a while the activity will display the game information correctly again.
