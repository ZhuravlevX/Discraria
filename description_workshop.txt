[h1][b] About the mod [/b][/h1]
[b] Discraria [/b] is a mod created by combining the names Terraria and Discord. This mod displays activity in your Discord profile using Rich Presence. Currently, this mod displays the following information about the player:
[list]
    [*]Player presence in the main menu;
    [*]The biome the player is in;
    [*]World type and difficulty;
    [*]Boss fighting;
    [*]Maximum health, mana, and defense.
[/list]

[h1][b] Modification issues  [/b][/h1]
Sometimes, when frequently changing activity in your Discord profile using Rich Presence ([i]For example: frequent movement between biomes[/i]), there is a chance that the activity may not update in your profile. To fix this issue, you need to wait a few seconds and then trigger an activity update ([i]For example: move to a new biome, die, summon a boss, exit to the menu[/i]). However, this is not necessary, as after a while the activity will display the game information correctly again.
